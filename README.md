### What is a Pomodoro?
* Decide on the task to be done.
* Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes)
* Work on the task.
* End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper
* If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes) and then return to step 2; otherwise continue to step 6.
* After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
